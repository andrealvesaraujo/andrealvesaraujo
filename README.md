### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Front End Developer intern at Trinks.com. I'm working with HTML5,CSS3, Javascript, SASS, KnockoutJS, Bootstrap, BEM methodology and Mobile First approach.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Undergraduate thesis in a Java project in github.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Hackathons and Front-End projects. Also i'd like to help and learn about game development with Unity or Unreal.

âš¡ Fun fact: I am into playing music keyboard in my free time.
